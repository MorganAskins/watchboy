Here is what has to be done
Find all needed .h and .c files needed by the data format to create a library libRN.so
From libRN.so use TTree::MakeClass to form a RNData.h class. Then derive a class from
this class named RNDataAnalysis.h which has all of the analysis methods.

(will use a makefile next)
Making the necessary .o files:

rootcint -f RNDict.cc -c (All the .h files)
ROOTLIBS='root-config --libs'
g++ -c -fPIC -Wall (each .cpp file) $ROOTLIBS
g++ -shared -O (all object files) -o libRN.so
